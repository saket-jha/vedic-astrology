<p><strong>No chart or tool should be used as a separate standalone tool ; Vedic Jyotisha should follow the <a href="index.html#toc10">Systems Approach</a>, and it is better to read the present whole page; results of all separate charts should be combined to get the final result for a particular event. When a particular chart is judged separately, it may appear to be an effort to prove an event selectively, but when results of all charts relevant to the event in question are combined together, the pattern gradually becomes clearer. Effects of all separate charts reinforce or cancel each other, and it is a time consuming job to add up such results. But we must avoid shortcuts.</strong></p>
<p>There are three methods in Vedic Astrology : General Method, DAC Method, and Special Techniques. DAC Method is based on Dasha Arambha Chakra illustrated in the Case Study of Indira Gandhi, see under 'Natal' button. Special Techniques are based on Bhrigu Samhita, Ravana Samhita, various Nadi texts, etc. General Method is the simple method which should be used for general practice of astrology. But now-a-days an over-simplified version of this general method is in vogue which is unreliable. Carefully read the following material for understanding the general method of Sage Parashara.</p>

<p>3, 6, और 11 वें भावों के स्वामी उत्तरोत्तर अशुभ होते हैं | 6, 8, और 12 वें भावों में बैठे ग्रह अशुभ होते हैं | 4, 7, 10 वां भाव &quot;केन्द्र&quot; कहलाते हैं जिनके स्वामी यदि नैसर्गिक (स्वभावतः) शुभ ग्रह हों तो अशुभ हो जाते हैं | नैसर्गिक शुभ ग्रह हैं बृहस्पति, शुक्र, शुक्लपक्ष का चन्द्रमा और अकेला या शुभग्रह सहित बुध | पापग्रह युक्त बुध अशुभ होता है | लग्न, 5 और 9 &quot;त्रिकोण&quot; हैं जिनके स्वामी सदैव शुभ होते हैं | नैसर्गिक अशुभ ग्रह (शनि, मंगल, सूर्य) यदि 3 या 11 में हों तो शुभ फल देते हैं, नैसर्गिक शुभ ग्रह उनमें हों तो अशुभ फल देते हैं | बलों के अनुसार ग्रहों का शुभत्व और अशुभात्व जोड़कर अन्तिम फल निकालना चाहिए | ग्रह जिस भाव में है उसमें पूर्ण फल देता है, अन्य भावों पर दृष्टि के अनुसार फल देता है, जिस भाव का स्वामी है उसपर दृष्टि नहीं भी हो तो आधा फल देता है और पूर्ण दृष्टि है तो पूरा फल होता ही है ऊपर से वहां बल भी बढ़ जाता है | ग्रह अपने सम्बन्धियों की दशा, अन्तर्दशा आदि में फल देते हैं | सभी कुंडलियों में ऐसे ही नियम हैं |</p>

समस्त सिद्धान्त-ग्रंथों और पुराणों के अनुसार <strong>सूर्यसिद्धान्त</strong> के अनुसार ही ग्रह साधन और तिथ्यादि का निर्धारण करना चाहिए | व्यास जी का स्पष्ट वचन है (विष्णुधर्मोत्तर पुराण) कि ग्रहण आदि घटनाओं में जहाँ दर्शन की आवश्यकता हो वहाँ ग्रहस्पष्ट आदि को दृक्कर्म संस्कार द्वारा दर्शन योग्य बनाना चाहिए, किन्तु तिथ्यादि में उनका प्रयोग कभी भी नहीं करना चाहिए| निर्णय-सिन्धु का भी वचन है कि अदृष्ट-फल हेतु सूर्य सिद्धान्त का प्रयोग करें| नारद पुराण में सूर्य सिद्धान्त का विस्तृत गणित भी दिया गया है| अन्य सभी पुराणों में गणना के लिये सूर्यसिद्धान्त का ही प्रयोग किया गया है और सूर्य सिद्धान्त का ही निचोड़ भी प्रस्तुत किया गया है| परन्तु पिछली कुछ शताब्दियों से भौतिकवादियों का बोलबाला बढ़ गया है, जो भौतिक पिंडों को ही ज्योतिषीय ग्रह मानते हैं, किन्तु ऐसा करने पर ज्योतिषीय-ग्रहस्पष्ट में कई अंशों तक का अंतर पड़ जाता है, और षोडश-वर्गों में कई तो एकदम अशुद्ध बन जाते हैं और फलादेश सही नहीं निकलते|</p>

<p>यन्त्रवेधादिनाज्ञात यद्बीजं गणकैस्ततः।<br />

<p>&quot;यन्त्र द्वारा वेधादि द्वारा जो बीज ज्ञात हों उन्हें ग्रहणादि (जैसी दर्शनीय घटनाओं) के परीक्षण में प्रयुक्त करें, (पञ्चांग में प्रयुक्त) तिथ्यादि में बिलकुल नहीं |&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;अदृष्ट (प्रारब्ध) फल की सिद्धि हेतु सूर्यसिद्धान्त (अर्क-गणित = सूर्यगणित, ज्योतिष के गणित को सिद्धान्त कहते हैं) का प्रयोग करें, दृष्ट प्रयोजन यदि हो तो उसके लिए दृष्ट से उद्भूत गणित सदा प्रयुक्त करें |&quot;</p>

<strong>विंशोत्तरी आदि चंद्राधारित दशाएं दैनिक गति द्वारा भयात् और भभोग से निकालने की स्थूल परिपाटी चल पड़ी है</strong> जिस कारण घटनाओं के काल में महिनों और कभी-कभी वर्षों की अशुद्धि हो जाती है| विंशोत्तरी का निर्धारण चन्द्र की आकाशीय स्थिति से होता है, अतः इष्टकालीन <strong>चन्द्र-स्पष्ट द्वारा विंशोत्तरी आदि की गणना करनी चाहिए</strong>|</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>३-</strong></span><br />
<strong>विंशोत्तरी आदि दशाएं चन्द्र से बनती हैं इसलिए उनमे ३६० तिथियों के चान्द्रवर्ष मान का प्रयोग करना चाहिए|</strong> अधिक-मास चान्द्रवर्ष से बाहर माना जाता है, जिस कारण इसका नाम अधिक-मास या मलमास पड़ा| विंशोत्तरी का वर्ष ३६० चान्द्रदिनों का होता है, किन्तु स्वर्गीय निर्मलचन्द्र लाहिड़ी जी ने इसाई कैलंडर का अभ्यास होने के कारण ३६० सौर दिनों का वर्षमान प्रचलित कर दिया जो एक गलत विचार है| ९ प्रकार के वर्षमान होते हैं, परन्तु ३६० सौर दिनों का वर्ष उनमे से कोई भी नहीं होता| अतः लाहिड़ी जी के अनुगामियों ने ३६५.२४२२ दिनों का इसाई वर्ष विंशोत्तरी पर लागू कर दिया है जिसके कारण प्रत्येक ३३ वर्षों में १ वर्ष की त्रुटि हो जाती है, क्योंकि ३६० तिथियों का वर्ष ३५४.३७ सौर दिनों का होता है| उपरोक्त कई त्रुटियाँ जुड़कर कई वर्षोँ की त्रुटियाँ उत्पन्न कर देती हैं, जिस कारण अन्तर्दशा भी कदाचित ही सही बन पाती है| जबकि विंशोत्तरी के फल का मौलिक नियम यह है कि महादशा से लेकर प्राणदशा तक सभी दशा कारक ग्रहों के फलादेशों का कुल योग ही घटना का कारक होता है| केवल महादशा या अन्तर्दशा से जीवन की मुख्य धारा का स्थूल अनुमान ही लगाया जा सकता है, सही घटना और घटना काल की भविष्यवाणी नहीं की जा सकती| cf. <a href="start.html#toc6">http://vedicastrology.wikidot.com/start#toc6</a></p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>४-</strong></span><br />
विंशोत्तरी आदि चंद्राधारित दशाएं चंद्रमा से बनाने का आदेश है, जिसका अर्थ यह है कि किसी वर्ग में चन्द्र की जो स्थिति है उसी के अनुसार उस वर्ग की विंशोत्तरी आदि दशा बनानी चाहिए| अतः <strong>१६ वर्गों के लिये १६ विंशोत्तरी सारिणियाँ, १६ अष्टोत्तरी सारिणियाँ, १६ योगिनी सारिणियाँ और १६ काल चक्र सारिणियाँ बनेंगी</strong>|</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>५-</strong></span><br />
पराशर होराशास्त्र के दशाफलाध्याय में दो बार दशाओं का फल जानने के लिये <strong>दशारम्भ काल की कुण्डली</strong> बनाने का आदेश दिया गया है, किन्तु प्रायः सभी ज्योतिषी जन्मकालिक कुंडली से ही दशाफल निकालते हैं| किसी भी ग्रह की दशा जीवन का हिस्सा ही होती है अतः पूरे जीवन पर प्रभाव डालने वाली जन्म कुण्डली से किसी विशेष दशाकाल का फल निकालने पर प्रायः सही फल मिलता है| किन्तु यदि दशारम्भ काल की कुण्डली जन्मकालिक कुण्डली का विरोध कर दे तो सामान्यतः दशारम्भ काल की कुण्डली का फल ही प्रभावी होता है, बशर्ते दशारंभ-कुंडली का दशाकारक-ग्रह अत्यधिक निर्बल न हो और जन्म-कुंडली में वही ग्रह अति-बली न हो |</p>
<p>दशारम्भ कालीन कुण्डली बनाने की परंपरा मिट चुकी है, क्योंकि जन्मकाल में एक सेकेण्ड की त्रुटि होने पर दशारम्भ कालीन D-१ (भावचलित) में एक राशि की त्रुटि हो जाती है, अन्य वर्गों में तो और भी अधिक त्रुटि हो जाती है| D-६० (षष्ट्यंश) तक का शुद्ध- शुद्ध दशारम्भ चक्र केवल तभी बन सकता है जब जन्मकाल में एक सेकेण्ड के सौवें भाग की शुद्धता रहेगी| इसके लिये दो विधियों का प्रयोग किया जाता था, जिसमे से एक विधि सूतिका गृह के लक्षण पर आधारित थी (जिसपर पराशर जी ने पूरा अध्याय लिखा है) और दूसरी गर्भाधान लग्न (जिसपर जैमिनी सूत्र का पूरा चौथा अध्याय है) पर आधारित थी| ये दोनों विधियां बेकार हो चुकी है, क्योंकि न तो अब सूतिका गृह का विस्तृत विवरण सुरक्षित रखा जाता है, और न ही कोई हिन्दू अब गर्भाधान संस्कार का प्रयोग करता है| अतः अब कम्प्यूटर की सहायता से जीवन की मुख्य घटनाओं के विश्लेषणात्मक अध्ययन द्वारा जन्म समय को सेकेण्ड के सौवें हिस्से तक शुद्ध किया जाय, जिसमे कई दिन और कई बार तो कई हप्ते भी लग सकते हैं| इसके बाद भी सफलता मिल ही जायेगी यह सुनिश्चित नहीं है| अतः ब्रह्मचर्यं पालन द्वारा इस विधि अभ्यास करना चाहिए जैसा कि बृहत् पराशर होरा शास्त्र में बताया गया है | दैवी कृपा होने पर शुद्ध समय के मिलने की सम्भावना होती है| यह विधि कलियुग के सामान्य लोगों के लिये नहीं है, ऐसा पाराशर जी ने पराशर होराशास्त्र के दूसरे खंड के आरम्भ में बताया है|</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>६-</strong></span><br />
अनेक <strong>षोडश वर्ग</strong> पराशर ऋषि के कथनानुसार नहीं बनाये जाते हैं, उदाहरणार्थ चतुर्विंशांश वर्ग कुंडली के निर्माण में स्पष्ट आदेश है कि सम राशियों में उल्टा क्रम होना चाहिए, परन्तु सभी भाष्यकार राशियों के देवों का क्रम तो उल्टा कर देते हैं परन्तु राशियों का क्रम सीधा रखते हैं| इसका कारण यह है कि इन भाष्यकारों ने उच्चवर्गों का प्रयोग व्यावहारिक जीवन में किया ही नहीं| ऐसे ही लोग द्रेष्काण कुण्डली १२ भावों का बनाते हैं, जबकि होरा कुंडली २ भावों का का बनाते हैं, और यह ध्यान नहीं रखते कि होरा और द्रेष्काण कुण्डलियों के निर्माण की विधि एक समान है|</p>
<p>षोडश वर्ग विवेचानाध्याय में स्पष्ट लिखा है कि सभी वर्गों में भाव १२ होते हैं, जब कि षोडश वर्ग देवताओं की संख्या वर्ग संख्या के बराबर होती है| उदाहरणार्थ होरा कुण्डली में दो देव सूर्य और चन्द्र होते हैं, द्रेष्काण में तीन, और षष्ट्यंश कुण्डली में साठ देव होते हैं| देवों को भाव समझना गलत है| इस त्रुटि का कारण यह है कि वेद-वेदांगादि का अध्ययन ब्रह्मचर्य आश्रम में होता है, और पराशर जी ने भी सही फलादेश करने के लिये जितेन्द्रिय होने को आवश्यक शर्त माना है| जो ब्रह्मचर्य का पालन नहीं करते वे सिद्धान्त, संहिता और होरा ग्रंथों और शास्त्रादि का मनमाना अर्थ लगाते हैं और गलत फलादेश करके ज्योतिष शास्त्र की प्रतिष्ठा को नष्ट करते हैं|</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>७-</strong></span><br />
षोडश वर्गों से फलादेश का मूल नियम :<br />
षोडश वर्गों में चार प्रकार के उपवर्ग प्रसिद्ध हैं : <strong>षड्वर्ग, सप्तवर्ग, दशवर्ग और षोडशवर्ग</strong>|प्रयोजन के अनुसार वर्गों और उनके विन्शोपक बलों का परिवर्तन होता रहता है; उदाहारणार्थ : विवाह का निर्धारण संबंधी समस्त फलों के लिए षड्वर्ग का प्रयोग होता है, सन्तान का निर्धारण संबंधी समस्त फलों के लिए सप्तवर्ग, आजीविका और महत्वपूर्ण कार्य संबंधी समस्त फलों के लिए दशवर्ग तथा समस्त कार्यों के लिये षोडशवर्ग का विचार करने की परंपरा थी, जिसका प्रयोग आधुनिक ज्योतिषीगण नहीं करते|</p>
<p>यदि किसी के जीवन में धन, भूमि, वाहन, रोग तथा विद्या आदि अन्यान्य विषय देखने हों तो वर्गों का संयोजन तथा विन्शोपक बल का वितरण या वितरण में परिवर्तन किस प्रकार करना चाहिए ये किसी भी ग्रन्थ में नहीं लिखा है| उदहारण के लिये यदि किसी के जीवन में यदि धन-सम्पत्ति का विस्तृत विचार करना है तो भाव चलित (D-१), होराचक्र (D-२), नवमांश चक्र (D-९) तथा दशमांश चक्र (D-१०) का विचार तो निश्चित तौर पर करना ही चाहिए, चतुर्थांश (भाग्य)(D-४), खवेदांश (D-४०), अक्षवेदांश (D-४५) एवं षष्ट्यंश (D-६०) का भी प्रयोग करें कि न करें यह प्रश्न उठता है, जिसका समाधान यह है कि इन संदेहास्पद वर्गों का प्रयोग विशेष परिस्थितियों में ही करना चाहिए सदैव नहीं, जैसे कि खवेदांश (D-४०) का प्रयोग मातृपक्ष से मिलने वाली धन सम्पत्ति के लिये तथा अक्षवेदांश (D-४५) का प्रयोग पितृपक्ष से मिलने वाली सम्पत्ति के लिये करना चाहिए | विभिन्न वर्गों के फलों का योग कैसे करें इसके लिये दो पैमाने हैं : (१) वर्ग विशेष का विन्शोपक बल तथा (२) दशाकारक ग्रह का बल (उच्चादि और षड्बल आदि)|</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>८-</strong></span></p>
<p>कलियुग के मंदबुद्धि पापियों के लिये जो सरल विधियाँ पराशर जी ने बताई, शुद्ध रूप से उनका प्रयोग भी अधिकतर ज्योतिषी नहीं करते| वे विधियाँ है <strong>अष्टकवर्ग</strong> और <strong>वर्ष-प्रवेश, मास-प्रवेश, प्रत्यंतर-प्रवेश, आदि सहित सुदर्शनचक्र</strong>, जिसमे अष्टकवर्ग का फल तो कमजोर होता है परन्तु सुदर्शन चक्र भविष्यफल के लिये महत्वपूर्ण यंत्र है जिसके सही प्रयोग द्वारा घटनाओं का घंटा, मिनट तक बताने वाली ऐसी भृगुसंहिता बनाई जा सकती है जो संसार में किसी के पास नहीं है| विंशोत्तरी, सुदर्शन चक्र, आदि के साथ प्रयोग किया जाय तो अष्टकवर्ग भी बहुत उपयोगी सिद्ध हो सकता है।</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>९-</strong></span><br />
उपरोक्त सभी त्रुटियों का समाधान करने के बाद भी सही फलादेश वही कर सकता है जो शास्त्र ज्ञान, संस्कृत व्याकरण, आदि सहित जितेन्द्रिय होने की पराशर जी की शर्तो को पूर्ण करे, और मनुस्मृति और व्यास जी के वचनों को मानते हुए यजमान से पारिश्रमिक न मांगे, और बिन माँगी दक्षिणा से संतोष करे।</p>
<p>उपरोक्त प्रमुख कारणों के अलावा कुछ गौण कारण भी हैं जो उपरोक्त कारणों का समाधान होने पर धीरे धीरे स्वतः सही हो जायेंगे।</p>
<p>मेदिनी ज्योतिष में आजकल की जाने वाली त्रुटियों का उल्लेख यहाँ नहीं किया जा रहा है। तत्संबंधी लेखों में उनका उल्लेख प्रस्तुत वेबसाइट पर ही किया गया है।</p>

<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>1-</strong></span><br />
According to all Siddhantic and Puranic texts, <strong>Suryasiddhanta</strong> should be used to compute the position of the planets and in determining Tithis etc. Sage Vyasa has clearly said (Vishnudarmottara Purāna; see Sanskrit verse below) that in perceivable events like eclipse etc,where an actual observation is needed, the position of the planets should be further corrected using Drika-Karma corrections so that they can be used in determining the actual event, but these Drik-corrections should never be made use of in computation of Tithis etc. विष्णुधर्मोत्तरपुराण :</p>
<p>यन्त्रवेधादिनाज्ञात यद्बीजं गणकैस्ततः।<br />
ग्रहणादि परीक्षेत न तिथ्यादि कदाचन।।</p>
<p>'Nirnaya Sindhu' (see Sanskrit verse below)) also states that for invisible results used for knowing Fortune (&quot;Adrishta&quot;), Suryasiddhanta should be made use of. The detailed mathematics of Suryasiddhanta is also given in the Narada Purana. In all other Puranas too, Suryasiddhanta has been made use of for the purpose of computation and its essense has been presented. But since a few previous centuries, materialists have begun to dominate the scene and they consider the physical planets to be the astrological planets. But by doing so, a discrepancy of several degrees is introduced in the actual position of the astrological planets, and this error gets further amplified in the Shodashavargas, leading to completely incorrect predictions. निर्णय-सिन्धु :</p>
<p>अदृष्ट-फल-सिध्यर्थ यथार्कगणितं कुरु।<br />
गणितं यदि दृष्टार्थ तद्दृष्ट्युद्भव तस्सदा।।</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>2-</strong></span><br />
<strong>Dashas like Vimshottari etc which are based on the position of the Moon are now being computed crudely by using &quot;Bhayāta&quot; (degrees already traversed by Moon) and Bhabhoga(degrees left to be traversed by Moon) using daily motion of the Moon</strong>. Because of this popular trend, an error of several months or even several years is introduced in the computation of events. Vimshottari is computed by making use of the position of the Moon in the sky, hence <strong>Vimshottari should be computed using the exact degrees of the Moon at the desired time</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>3-</strong></span><br />
<strong>Dashas like Vimshottari etc are computed using the Moon, hence in their computation a Lunar year comprising of 360 Tithis should employed.</strong> The Adhika-masa (intercalary month) is considered outside the domain of Lunar year, which is why it is named &quot;Intercalary Month&quot; (between two calendar years, i.e. not a part of religious calendrical year) or &quot;Mala-Masa&quot; (impure month). The year of Vimshottari consists of 360 Lunar days, but Late Nirmal Chandra Lahari Ji introduced the concept of 360 Solar days because of the habit of the Christian calender. This is a wrong decision. There are 9 kinds of years, but there is none amongst them which is made of 360 solar days. The followers of Mr Lahiri have applied the Christian year consisting of 365.2422 days in the Vimshottari dasha computation because of which an error of 1 year is introduced in every 33 years. This is because 360 lunar days consist of 354.37 solar days. The many kinds of errors which have been mentioned above accumulate and introduce an error of several years because of which the Antardashas (sub-periods) are seldom correct. Whereas the basic principle of Vimshottari is that all planets, right from the Mahadasha upto the Prana Dasha, are involved in influencing and give rise to an event. Using merely Mahadashas and Antardashas, a crude flow of one's life can be estimated, but the exact events and their exact timings cannot be pin-pointed. cf. <a href="start.html#toc6">http://vedicastrology.wikidot.com/start#toc6</a></p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>4-</strong></span><br />
Moon-based dashās like Vimshottari are ordered to be made from Moon, hence Vimshottari for any particular divisional (varga) should be made from Moon's longitudes in that divisional. Hence, 16 divisionals should have 16 Vimshottari tabl;es, 16 Ashtottari tables, 16 Yogini Tables, 16&#160;Kālachakra tables, etc.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>5-</strong></span><br />
In the chapter of 'Dasha Phala' in Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra (BPHS), making chart at the time of commencement of the Dasha has been instructed twice. But almost all astrologers base their dashā-predictions on the birth chart itself. The period of any planet is a part of the entire lifetime of an individual, and the birth chart influences one's entire life, hence the birth chart can be used to crudely predict the results for a particular dasha. But if the Dasha-ārambha chart contradicts the birth chart then it is usually the Dasha-ārambha chart which overrules the predictions based on the birth chart, provided the planet of that period is not very weak with respect to that very planet in the birth chart.</p>
<p>The tradition of making Dasha onset chart (DPC or Dasha Pravesha Chakra) has died out, because 1 second of error in birth-time produces one sign of error in D1 of DPC, and this error is amplified further in other divisionals of DPC. Correct D-60 (shashtyamsha) chart of DPC can be made only if birth time is accurate upto at least one hundredth of a second. Two techniques were used used to achieve this accuracy : one technique was based on characteristics of birth or sootikā room on which one full chapter has been devoted in BPHS, and the second technique was based on garbhādhāna-lagna (horoscope at the time of conception) on which one full chapter is devoted in Jaimini Sutra. Both these techniques are useless now, because neither detailed records of birth-room are preserved, nor any Hindu now performs garbhādhāna-samskāra. Hence, birth-time rectification upto one hundredth of a second should be attempted with the help of computer by means of analysis of chief events of life, but it may involve any days or weeks without any guarranttee of success. Hence this technique should be used with brahmacharya &amp;c as prescribed in BPHS. Correct birth-time may be obtained with divine grace. BPHS states at the start of second part that this method is not for common mortals of Kaliyuga.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>6-</strong></span><br />
Many Shodashavargas are not computed using the recommendations of sage Parashara. For example, in the computation of D-24, there is a clear instruction that the order is reversed in even signs. But while all commentators do reverse the order of the Deities in D-24 , they don't reverse the order of the signs. The reason for this is that these commentators have never made use of these finer divisions in actual practice. Same types of astrologers make a D-3 chart with 12 houses and a D-2 chart with 2 houses and forget to take note of the fact that the rules for construction of D-2 and D-3 are similar.</p>
<p>In the chapter of Shodashavargas it is written clearly that all divisional charts have 12 houses, while the number of deities in a Shodashavarga is equal to the number of the divisional chart. For example, in the Hora chart (D-2), there are two deities :- Sun and Moon. In the D-3 chart, there are 3 deities and in the D-60 chart there are 60 deities. Considering the deities to be identical to the number of houses is wrong. The reason for the introduction of this erroroneous notion is that the Vedas and Vedangas are studied in the Brahmacharya-ashram and sage Parashara has said that to predict correctly one should be in full control of his sense organs (essential condition for Brahmacharya). Theose who do not observe Brahmacharya misinterpret the Siddhanta, Samhita and Hora texts wilfully and make faulty predictions and by doing so they destroy the reputation of Jyotisha.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>7-</strong></span><br />
<strong>Basic rules to predict on the basis of Sixteen Divisionals</strong>:<br />
In the Shodashavargas, four kinds of secondary-divisions are famous - Shadvarga, Saptavarga, Dashavarga and Shodashavarga. The Divisionals (vargas) and their vimshopaka strengths are modified according to their use/purpose. For example, for all matters related to marriage, Shad-vargas (6 vargas) are used. For matters related to progeny, Sapta-vargas (7 vargas) are used. For matters related to career and important achievements in life, Dashavargas (10 vargas) are used. For all matters Shodashavargas (16 vargas) are used. This was always used in practice traditionally, but contemporary astrologers don't make use of this rule.</p>
<p>If one has to judge someone's wealth, lands, vehicles, diseases, learning or other matters then the results of divisionals have to be combined and their vimshopaka strengths have to be assigned or modified accordingly. The rules for these are not mentioned in any text. For example, if one has to judge matters related to wealth in detail in someone's life, then Bhavachalita (D-1), Hora (D-2), Navamsha (D-9) and Dashamamsha (D-10) must be necessarily analyzed. But the questions arises as to whether D-4, D-40, D-45 and D-60 should be studied or not. The answer to this question is that these divisions should be used only in special circumstances and not always. For example, D-40 should be used to study the wealth obtained from the maternal side. D-45 should be used to study the wealth obtained from the paternal side. There are two ways to combine the results obtained from different vargas : (1) Vimshopaka strengths of those vargas and (2) The strength of the planet whose dasha is running (exaltation state, Shadbala i.e. six-fold strength etc).</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>8-</strong></span><br />
Even those methods are not used correctly of by most astrologers which are mentioned by sage Parasara for the &quot;less intelligent and sinful people belonging to Kaliyuga&quot;. Those means are (1)Asktakavarga and (2) Sudarshanchakra on the basis of Varsha-pravesha (annual charts), Masa-pravesha (monthhly charts), Pratyantara-pravesha (dasha entry) etc . Amongst these, the results from Ashtakavarga are not that strong, but Sudarshanchakra is an important tool for prediction. If it is used properly then one can construct a Bhrigu Samhita, which is unavailable to anyone in the world, using which timing ofevents to the extent of hours, minutes can be feasible. If used with Vimshottari, Sudarshana Chakra etc then Ashtakavarga can also prove to be very useful.</p>

Even after taking care of all the possible errors listed above, only that person can make a correct prediction, according to the criteria laid down by sage Parashara, who is learned in astrological classics by sages, Sanskrit grammar etc and has his sense organss in full control (i.e., practises Brahmacharya), and abides by the guidelines of Manusmriti and sage Vyasa does not ask for money from the client (Yajmana) and remains satisfied with the Dakshinā without asking for it (Dakshinā is obligatory donation).</p>
<p>Apart from the major reasons listed above, there are some secondary reasons too which automatically and gradually get resolved once these major hurdles are overcome.</p>
<p>The errors which are made in Medini Jyotisha are not being listed here. They will be listed in the relevant articles on this very website itself.</p>

<p>A good doctor needs years of study and practice to become a good doctor. Astrology is a more difficult discipline. Unfortunately, majority of astrologers depend on shortcuts, which is destroying this great science. There are three approaches to Vedic Astrology :</p>
<p>(1)<br />
Standard Parashari Method : it is based on DAC (Dashā Arambha Chakra) including the rest of tools and techniques in First Part of BPHS. But DAC needs very accurate birth time which is possible only in a handful of cases, and with much difficulty. Read <a href="start.html#toc7">Standard Method</a> defined below.</p>
<p>(2)<br />
Shortcut Parashari Method, which must be mastered before using DAC method. This shortcut method is described in Second Part of BPHS. It is primarily based on SC (Sudarshana Chakra) with help from birth-time charts and Vimshottari and VPC (Varsha Pravesha Chakra), with help from AV (Ashtaka Varga) if doubt arises. But now-a-days even this shortcut is not used by astrologers who want to spend less time on a chart. Read <a href="start.html#toc7">Standard Method</a> defined below.</p>
<p>(3)<br />
Some esoteric methods which are based on ancient manuscripts never fully described and published. These methods cannot be used by the uninitiated and by those who do not have access to those manuscripts. The custodians of these manuscripts keep their manuscripts secret for financial reasons, which is unfortunate. There are many frauds in this field too. This field includes Nadi Astrology, Bhrigu Samhita, Ravana Samhita, etc. But the methodology of these techniques have been lost. For Kaliyuga (present epoch), BPHS is the STANDARD.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">=========================================</p>
<p>Planets seated in following houses give good results in the following order, goodness decreasing and maleficence rising as we go rightwards in the following list :</p>
<p>1, 9, 5, 10, 4, 7,, 3, 11, 2, 6, 8, 12</p>
<p>Lords of following houses make the planets benefic and malefic in same manner, left to right :</p>
<p>1, 9, 5, 10, 4, 7,, 2, 8, 12, 3, 6, 11</p>
<p>Both lists are 75% identical , only three houses (3, 6, 11) change their places in the order.</p>
<p>It is a general rule, but for specific topics this general order needs to be changed. For instance, 2H and 7H are malefic for health, 11L is malefic for all topics, but 2H and 11H are good for money/wealth/income.</p>
<p>Exalted planets are hughly benefic if they are functionally benefic too. An exalted planet is most strongly malefic if it lords 6H and 11H.</p>
<p>STRENGTH of Planets :</p>
<p>The prinmcipal STRENGTH of any planet is to be measured in the following order :</p>
<p>1 - exalted<br />
2 - in moola trikona<br />
3 - in own sign<br />
4 - in fast friendly sign<br />
5 - in friendly sign<br />
6 - in neutral sign<br />
7 - in inimical sign<br />
8 - in bitter inimical sign<br />
9 - in debilitation</p>
<p>This is the chief scale, each ladder on this scale almost doubles the strength. If two planets having same strength on this scale are competing for supremacy, we have to look into shadbala (otherwise shadbala should be overlooked). In shadbala scaling, the weak planet has almost half the strength of the strongest planet. Hence, shadbala scaling shows the finer strength within two levels of the chief scale shown above.</p>
<p>Combust planets get the traits of Sun and lose their own strengths ; debilitated planets in relation with strong planets also lose their own properties and get the qualities of strong relatives and bahave likewise. That is why combust or debilitated planets sometimes give excellent results.</p>
<p>Avasthas , bhāva-sandhis, etc give finer shades. An exalted planet in mrita avastha is not mrita. Any conclusion must be based on taking into consideration all factors.</p>
<h1 id="toc6"><span><span style="font-size:150%;"><span style="color:Red"><strong>Astrological versus Physical Planets</strong></span></span></span></h1>
<p>All concepts from Physical Astronomy (such as Super Moon or rays of visible Sun &amp;c) come from the FAITH in the SENSORILY PERCEIVED PHYSICAL (MATERIAL) things which is so rampant now-a-days due to propaganda by physical scientists against Astrology. If changes in distance of Moon should have astrological effect. so should have the respective distances of all planets. Then, farther planets should not have any appreciable astrological effect on Earth. For instance, physical Saturn is 3713 times farther than the Moon, and according to inverse square law, its gravitational and other physical forces should be proportional to inverse of square of distance, ie Saturn's physical forces should be 13784230 times less than those of Moon for equal mass. But Saturn is 95 times heavier than Earth and Earth is 81 times heavier than Moon, hence Saturn is nearly 7700 times heavier than Moon. Therefore, Saturn's actual physical (gravitational, electromagnetic) forces should be 13784230 divided with 7700 = 1790 times weaker than those of Moon, which is too high to allow Saturn to exert any perceptible impact on Earth with respect to Moon. Only Sun and Moon have compararable physical forces acting on Earth, Moon being the strongest, and all other planets are thousands of times weaker. But in astrology, if astrological factors like uchchādi or aspects are the same then astrological impacts are same for all planets. Hence, physical characteristics of planets like size, mass, distance, gravitation, electric force, magnetism, etc have ZERO role in astrology. It is only a deliberate design of God to give same name to astrological and physical planets so that materialists remain confused and do not get the benefits of a divine discipline like Jyotisha. Tghe only proper way to study astrology is to follow the philosophy and guidelines laid down by rishi-based classics and other supportive texts, without tampering with the fundamental tenets of astrology. All astrological tests should be based purely on ASTROLOGICAL criteria and not on materialist criteria, because material objects do not possess astrological properties according to any scientific study in the world (and the reverse is also true ; astrological planets do not have material or physical properties, as shown above).</p>
<h1 id="toc7"><span><span style="font-size:150%;"><span style="color:Red"><strong>Year Length for Moon-based Dashās like Vimshottari</strong></span></span></span></h1>
<p>The dashās (periods) of planets computed according to Drik (physical astronomy) and Christian Calendar do not tally with actual events and the discrepancy sometimes go upto a few years, which renders finer dashās unusable and only MD is correct for a large majority of cases, AD being often correct and often incorrect. That is why alternative mechanisms for timing of events are required for users of Drik Ganita. But when Suryasiddhantic Ganita and Hindu Calendar of 360 lunar days (tithis) are used for Moon based dashā systems like Vimshottari, events are times correctly, provided SC and VPC are jointly used for timing of events, occassionally helped by AV.</p>
<p>This is why fruits appear BEFORE the actual timing if Christian Calendar is used for Vimshottari. The difference between Christian and Hindu calendars is of about11 days which is nearly 3% of one year. Hindu year of 360 lunar days (tithis) is shorter by 3%. Hence, nearly 33 Vimashottari Years will be equal to 32 Christian years and if Christian Year is used for Vimshottari then planetary fruits will appear one year BEFORE the actual timing indicated by Christian Year count. This is an average figure, differences in planetary formulas of SS vs Drik bring about some changes in actual amounts of differences. In the case of Amitabh Bachchan, during the main part of his career, the difference between Christian Year and Lunar Year timings of Vimshottari was negligible, because difference in calendars was neutralized by difference in longitudes of Moon between SS and Drik, but such cases are few. In most cases, planetary fruits come BEFORE the actual date according to Christian Calendar, and this gap increases with the age of the native. Analysis of such deviations over a large number of natives led me to believe that Vimshottari Year must be lunar 360-tithi based. I was also told by older traditional astrologers that before the popularization of Christian Calendar, Vimshottari Year was Lunar.</p>
<h1 id="toc8"><span><span style="font-size:150%;"><span style="color:Red"><strong>STANDARD METHOD OF VEDIC JYOTISHA</strong></span></span></span></h1>
<p>My basic philosophy is that any astrological rule must never be applied in isolation. The moment someone applies a rule or yoga statically on a chart, and deduces a final conclusion on that basis, he/she disqualifies him/her-self for studying astrology. Before applying any rule or yoga, first of all you must learn the DIFFICULT technique (which requires decades of training, control of sense organs, Sātvika life-style, knowledge of Sanskrit grammar and Hora-shastra &amp;c as mentioned in BPHS) of finding out the CURRENTLY DOMINANT CHART out of a vast complex of charts in a given horoscope :</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">-</span><br />

<p>(b) similar charts of DAC (Dashā Arambha Chakrs or Dashā Onset Charts) of predominant Dashā for the particular topic at hand ; but making Vimshottari's DAC is a Herculean task now-a-days, and therefore this <strong>Standard Method</strong> of BPHS based on all earlier rishis is not applicable in vast majority of cases in Kaliyuga, and you must use the charts mentioned above and the below under points (a) and (c),</p>
<p>(c) and Gochara, Transit, AV charts, VPC (Varsha Pravesha Chakras or annual charts in standard chart method and their four other finer levels) and their SC annual (and finer level) dashās.<br />

<p>If you have a very strong and dominant Jyotishi-yoga in your chart, you will never ask questions to other mortals, and God will help you to find out correct prediction intuitively either without seeing the horoscope or by means of very simple horoscope (eg, mere rasi chart). I have seen many astrologers making correct predictions on the basis of wrong tools and techniques, just because they had good yoga at that time, and vice versa : wrong predictions even after using correct method just because their current dashās &amp;c were not good.</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone aspiring to learn astrology should not feel content with yogas in horoscope and must always try to improve the knowledge of classics, because Fate must be transformed by means of new Karma (Purushārtha tranforms Prārabdha, the latter itself is a result of past Karmas).</p>
<p>Although finding out the currently dominant chart is very difficult and requires scrutiny of all above charts, in actual case studies published in books and online, we can publish only the summaries and not the great details, which sometimes gives the impression that the astrologer uses only a shortcut. Due to this confusion, most of the modern astrologers now use shortcuts, which generally cheat them.</p>
<p>But there is another side of this coin : one astrologer wrote that traditional astrologers did not use the vast plethora of tools and techniques now easily available in astrological softwares, and made correct predictions on the basis of few tools mostly based on D-1, and therefore their SIMPLE technique needs to be re-discovered. Here is the solution :</p>
<p>A good traditional as well as modern doctor needs decades of training in all branches of his discipline, but while examining a patient he/she quickly finds out the problem without testing his/her entire knowledge and all tools/techniques on the patient. How he/she succeeds in getting a Quick Diagnosis ? Due to three factors :</p>
<p>(1) Theoretical Knowledge and practical Experience of the doctor/astrologer,</p>
<p>(2) Severity of the affliction of the person seeking help from the doctor/astrologer helps in Quick Diagnosis, because it is easy to diagnose the reason of a severe problem such as a cobra-bite in comparison to a small problem like a mosquito bite, and</p>
<p>(3) Yogas in the horoscope of the doctor/astrologer as well as the patient.</p>
<p>In practical chart reading for those persons who come to me for seeking help, I do not need to look into great details in a vast majority of cases, because severity of the problem helps me to diagnose it quickly. Sometimes, I need not even look at the horoscope. For instance, once I met a scholar of Sanskrit grammar for the first time in my life (Prof Sadanand Jha, D.Litt) who had some knowledge of Jyotisha too. In the first meeting, without telling me anything about his horoscope, he told me that Rahu in his Lagna creates problems for him, esp fights with others even if he does not want to fight. I looked at his nice and white face and answered that Rahu is ineffective in his Lagna because he must have a Chandra yoga which supresses Rahu's effects (I had even mentioned the name of that Chandra Yoga and also told him that his 3H has a benefic which will not allow his opponents to defeat him ; both these statements proved to be true because he was a virtuous pandit, and I was also living according to strict rules of Brahmacharya-ashrama &amp;c, which helps in getting divine help ; the client and the astrologer both must be virtuous and sincere for the chart reading to be correct). But when the help-seeker comes with a malefic intention (eg, for testing the astrologer instead of seeking a real help), then even world's best astrologer will not be able to help him/her. Help comes from ABOVE and not from mere bookish learning, Help comes when Help is sincerely sought, and Help comes when the client is sincerely ready to follow the procedures of propitation of malefic planets, and lastly Help comes when the client offers proper Dakshinā without asking, because when the astrologer is forced to ask for fees to maintain his/her family, Divine Help is denied to such an insensitive and selfish client and even the best astrologers fail to produce correct diagnosis for them.</p>
<h2 id="toc9"><span><span style="font-size:150%;"><span style="color:Red"><strong>Wrong Mediaeval Shortcut of Vedic Jyotisha</strong></span></span></span></h2>
<p>Scrutiny of mediaeval literature shows that D-1 was the only divisional chart which ruled on all horoscopes, and out of the remaining fifteen divisionals, only the two deities (but not the 12-house chart) of D-2 and sometimes D-9 were used by a few. Other divisionals were utterly neglected. In my article published in Gitapress's Kalyan magazine's Jyotisha special annual issue of 2014, I explained this phenomenon to be a result of modern worldly man's preoccupation with Body (D-1), Wealth (D-2) and Marriage (D-9).</p>
<p>With the advent of computers and astrological softwares, however, other divisionals and other neglected tools became readily available to astrologers.</p>
<p>But with so much benefits at the disposal of modern astrologer, we do not see any noticeable rise in performance. On the contrary, it is only CONFUSION which is growing. But I reached at a different conclusion during my investigation into this problem during past four decades (I had started studying astrology in 1975).</p>
<p>If it is to be concluded that lack of improvement in performance of those modern astrologers who are relying on so-called innovations should be taken as an argument in favour of rejecting all innovations, and that we should stick to traditional practices only, then I must add that traditional practice is not 16 divisionals and all those tools described in BPHS, because BPHS itself is a &quot;modern invention&quot; if I am permitted to use the language of some opponents of BPHS used for the tools and techniques described in BPHS. Bhatottapala was a famous astrologer of 10th century AD who had written a commentary on Brihat Samhita of Varaha Mihira, and in that commentary Bhatottapala wrote that Varaha Mihira spoke of a Hora-shāstra written by Sage Parashara but Bhatottapala was unable to find that Hora-shāstra ! And the famous modern astrologer Pt Sitaram Jha wrote in his Introduction to his edition of BPHS in 1946 (which is the basis of English version) that he was unable to see BPHS during his entire period of studying astrology in Varanasi and could find the first manuscript at the residence of Pt Jeevanath Jha many years after Pt Sitaram Jha had started teaching astrology in Sanskrit institution of Varanasi. Does it not imply that BPHS was not available to all astrologers during entire mediaeval era, although a handful of persons possessed its manuscript ? It clearly proves that the Hora texts of rishis like Bhrigu ji or Parashara ji were not available to traditional astrologers of historical times, and they were using simpler handy books like Jataka-Parijata, Phaladipika, etc etc . However, none of these simpler books were easily available throughout India, yet there was an All-India uniformity in most of the fundamentals of Vedic Jyotisha practiced throughout India even during that Dark Age which some persons wrongly assume to be the period of &quot;traditional&quot; Vedic Jyotisha.</p>
<p>Vedic Jyotisha, by its very definition, is the Jyotisha as taught by Vedic rishis, and not as practiced by Kaliyugi astrologers. PVR Narasimha Rao of JHora had once written that re-appearance of BPHS in recent decades suggests that we are entering into a new Golden Era of Jyotisha (I am expressing his sense in my words, citing his idea and not his exact words).</p>
<p>Beginning of a new era cannot be summed up on the basis of experience of two or three decades of an intermediate transition period, esp the experience of &quot;internet&quot; astrologers most of whom have little or no respect for rishis and their methods. By &quot;respect&quot; I mean actual performance of Rishi-yajna in daily life which is one of the five &quot;Pancha-maha-yajnas&quot; supposedly the essential duty of every Hindu.</p>
<p>If the argument about lack of &quot;increase&quot; in performance even after using computers and innovative techniques is taken as such, what is the guarantee that adherence to shortcuts of mediaeval traditions will increase the performance ?</p>
<p>My purpose here is not to start a debate for or against anyone, I am merely trying to show that the texts of rishis were NOT used by almost all traditional astrologers barring a handful. It is Kaliyuga, when rishis are not followed.</p>
<h2 id="toc10"><span><span style="font-size:150%;"><span style="color:Red"><strong>Correct Shortcut of Vedic Jyotisha</strong></span></span></span></h2>
<p>Now let me explain my point about D-2 and similar tools. No variety of D-2 or any divisional or any other chart will show any increase in performance unless and until the prevalent shortcut is completely discarded and the shortcut of BPHS is used. BPHS and other texts by rishis show three methods of Vedic Jyotisha :</p>
<p>(1)<br />
Special methods, such as described in partially available<br />
Bhrigu Samhita, Ravana Samhita, various ancient Nadi granthas, etc, but none of these texts can be used as the basis of a universally available software due to many problems,</p>
<p>(2)<br />
The Standard Method of BPHS which is primarily based on Dashā-phala to be deduced from DAC (Dashā-arambha-chakra), but DAC can be constructed only if certain data are known which can be available only if Garbhādhāna-samskāra is performed and Sootikā-griha's details are preserved, which no one follows now;</p>
<p>(3)<br />
and the SHORTCUT suggested in BPHS, which is scores of times longer than the prevalent shortcut. This shortcut may be called Parashari, although the rishi says that he invented nothing and presented only what was preached by former masters. Here is the summary of his shortcut which I always use, because I am able to use DAC only in few cases :-</p>
<p>i)<br />
For analysing any event, take D-1 and the relevant divisional, and never base the conclusion on D-1 alone.</p>
<p>ii)</p>
<p>Then, make two Vimshottari tables, based on D-1 and the relevant divisional, on the basis of Moon's Nakshatra in respective divisional chart (BPHS mentions it twice, although some modewrners may call it an &quot;innovation&quot; just because the tradition of Dark Age lacked most of the tools and techniques prescribed by rishis).</p>
<p>iii)<br />
Find out the final strengths of the ruling Vimshottari planets in both tables, and compare the strengths of these planets in D-1 with the strengths in the other divisional. For instance, if you need to analyze career, check D-1 and D-10, and then compare strengths of D-1's MD planet with D-10's MD planet. Use main strength, shadbala (only if main strength is same) and divisional-vimshopaka to get final strengths. For using Vimshottari and similar systems, it must be remembered that the sum total of all positive and negative fruits of all five Vimshottari planets gives the final fruit. Hence, accuracy of birth time is needed, in absence of which we must use some extra tools as shown below.</p>
<p>iv)<br />
Always use Sudarshana Chakra's three charts to judge any particular divisional chart, and never rest the judgment on Lagna Chart alone.</p>
<p>v)<br />
VPC (VArsha Pravesha Chakra) must never be overlooked, because if the Vimshottari planets are stronger in VPC then birthchart is suppressed by VPC. Do not use Tadjik methods, use standard principles of Vedic Jyotisha to analyze VPC (and monthly) charts.</p>
<p>vi)<br />
For better timing of events, use AV (Ashtaka-varga) also.</p>
<p>With the help of computers, it is easy to view all these charts within a few minutes, esp when the astrologer gets accustomed to this SHORTCUT. The prevalent shortcut inherited from Dark Age of Hinduism must be rejected, because it is useful only when the native has a very strong event for which Lagna Chart suppresses the relevant divisional as well as VPC and AV. But if the latter are stronger, then the birthchart is suppressed, and no software or innovation will improve the performance.</p>
<h2 id="toc11"><span><span style="font-size:150%;"><span style="color:Red"><strong>Correct 'SYSTEMS APPROACH' to Vedic Jyotisha</strong></span></span></span></h2>
<p>Let me first describe in brief, in the context of Vedic Astrology, the real Systems Approach as it is defined in modern physical and social sciences by established academics.</p>
<p>Following is the definition of the term &quot;Systems Approach&quot; according to an article jointly written by following professors, edited by the Vice Chancellor of Oxford University Allan Bullock :-</p>
<p>Stafford Beer (Visiting Professor of Cybernetics, University of Manchester, and Adjunct Professor of Social Systems Sciences, University of Pennsysvania),<br />
R. I. Tricker, Prof in Univ of Hong Kong,<br />
J. A. Mirrlees, Prof in Univ of Oxford,<br />
M. A. H. Dempster, Prof in Dunhousie Univ, New Brunswick :-</p>
<p><em>&quot;A systems approach (or systems analysis, though this phrase also bears the narrower meaning defined in (2) below) is an approach to the study of physical and social systems which enables complex and dynamic situations to be understood in broad outline. It is a conceptual tool, the user of which may also receive scientific assistance from Operational Research. The approach is valid whether the topic is a heating system, a postal system, a health or educational system, a firm, an economy, or a government. To identify a system it is necessary to distinguish its boundaries, to be aware of its purposes (whether these are a blueprint for its design or inferred from its behaviour), and to define the level of abstraction at which it is treated. Systems may turn out to contain recognizable sub-systems, sub-sub-systems, and so on. These arrangements are sometimes investigated as hierarchies; but because the arrangement often involves a nesting (in the manner of Chinese boxes) of systems within each other they may also be defined as Recursion. One of the discoveries made by the systems approach is the extent to which attempts to improve the performance of a sub-system by its own criteria (sub-optimization) may act to the detriment of the total system and even to the defeat of its objectives. &#8230;<br />
(2) More narrowly, systems analysis is the first stage in presenting any large task to a computer (the other stages being Programming and Coding)&#8230;dividing the process into a number of relatively independent parts&#8230;&quot;</em></p>
<p>Thus, Systems Approach is a valid approach to horoscope analysis, provided it is used correctly. Being a programmer of astrological software, I have to deal with &quot;system analysis&quot; in its technical narrow sense as defined above in (2), and as a Vedic Astrologer, I have to apply Systems Approach to chart reading in the wider sense as defined above. Let me describe the real &quot;Systems Approach&quot; as it should be applied to Vedic Astrology&quot;, which is actually what ancient rishis used.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;">Any specific Horoscope is to be regarded as one integral but open and dynamic system, which is part of a larger super-system. That larger super-system is the living individual who is an immortal Jeeva carrying fruits of karmas of past lives to this life, which are manifest through the Horoscope. That individual is also related to other individuals who influence him/her. The horoscope is not a closed and finite system, it is open to external influences, such as free will of the individual, his/her relations, planetary propitiation, worshipping or fasting, blessings of siddha persons, etc. Keeping this in mind, we can study the Horoscope as a unique system in two ways : (1) study the Horoscope according to its inner structures and their functions in the contexts of various events in life, and/or (2) take the Horoscope or any of its sub-systems as a Black Box without trying to study its inner structures and functions and concentrate on its external behaviour in different contexts in order to find out its manifest properties ; this latter approach can help us in confusing situations when classical rules are unclear. This Black Box approach is not the standard method and is only one of the diverse heuristic methods when classical standard method does not help us. <strong>The standard classical method of Vedic Astrology, which is same as Systems Approach (not of Mr V K Choudhary but of Sage Parashara) is to <em>take the Horoscope as one system consisting of many levels of hierarchical inner sub-systems and sub-sub-systems, each functioning according to some specific criteria unique to that sub-system but controlled by the larger and universal criteria of the main system, so that the sub-systems do not run independently of the whole system and do not thereby produce wrong or lop-sided results. Thus, the whole system has some unique complex STRUCTURE defined by sub-structures or sub-systems and their constituent elements, and FUNCTIONS defined by individual functions of those structures and their mutual interactions, collectively producing the overall fruits of the entire Horoscope for specified time or period.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;">Now let us see <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> Systems Approach can be actually applied to Vedic Astrology. Systems Approach is fruitful only when it is used with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Structural-Functional Approach</span> of modern sciences. When a whole system, e.g. a Horoscope, is analyzed in terms of its constituent sub-systems and their constituent elements, the overriding criterion used for defining the Structures and their mutual relations is the Function of the whole as well as the specific functions of its parts. <strong>Definition</strong> is a logical tool which distinguishes structural elements or sub-systems on the basis of their <em>essential</em> functions within the scope of that whole system. For instance, in the case of a particular astrological chart, a particular horoscopic House is an angular <strong><em>range</em></strong> within the entire stretch of 360 degrees of that chart which <em>functions</em> as a <strong>point (and not as a range) of contrast</strong> in an interlocking network of contrasts. <em><strong>This method of defining structural ranges as functional points of contrast in an interlocking network of contrasts is the most important conceptual foundation of structuralism-functionalism used in modern physical and social sciences, and can be applied to any hierarchical level or sub-system in astrological chart-reading.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;">For instance, <strong>an astrological planet should be defined not in terms of its physical properties and forces such as gravitation as used in physical science, but in terms of its astrological properties as mentioned in rishi-based classics.</strong> Conceptually, it is wrong to use physical astronomy for positions of planets and reject the properties of those planets according to the same physical astronomy. It is hypocrisy to use one part of modern physics and reject the remaining. And it is worse when such &quot;progress&quot; is suggested in the name of making Jyotisha more scientific. Either make Jyotisha entirely scientific by rejecting all non-scientific concepts and methods in traditional Jyotisha, or avoid mixing two entirely different systems : Jyotisha and Physics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;">For instance, the sub-system of Twelve-houses functions on the basis of twelve contrasting houses, each house distinguished by its specific properties which are in contrast to properties of some or all of other houses. These specific properties of any particular house are defined on the basis of multiple criteria, such as fixed properties of that house as either mentioned in classics or as deduced from classical rules (e.g., <a href="origin-and-meaning-of-horoscopic-houses.html">http://vedicastrology.wikidot.com/origin-and-meaning-of-horoscopic-houses</a>), properties of that house as defined by means of effects on other houses (e.g., 6H is 3rd from 4H and therefore 6H shows brother of mother), fixed properties of rashi/rashis in that house, properties of planets in that house or aspecting or owning that house and their relatives influencing that house, influence of other divisionals on the performance of that house, etc and all these factors contribute to the making of final fruit of that house known as Bhāva-phala. Therefore, the sub-system of Twelve-houses is influenced by other sub-systems, some of which are parallel sub-systems such as the sub-system of nine planets, while other sub-systems may be actually sub-sub-system hiearchically in the lower structural ladder of that sub-system such as the sub-system of aspects or the sub-system of ownerships, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;">Thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEFINE</span> each and every term in Jyotisha in proper astrological context. An astrological planet, therefore, should be defined strictly on the basis of its astrological characteristics, and nothing from Physics should be allowed to intrude into Jyotisha, otherwise one must start with rejecting Rahu-Ketu as planets, and end up with Sun and Moon as the only effective planets because others will have thousands and even millions of times weaker physical forces. Such a definition will allow us to apply systems approach in understanding the characteristics of planets and houses as sub-systems within a larger system, and these sub-systems will have finer sub-sub-systems such as aspects, friendships, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:180%;">Finally we will end up with a handful of charts interacting dynamically with each other simultaneously. For instance, for evaluating the prospects of wealth, we need to examine certain houses and planets in D-1 and then do the same examination of D-2, followed with comparison of their relative influences according to their dashās. In same way, annual chart and ashtaka-varga, transits, etc will also exert their influence. All these charts will have three variations : LK, SK and CK (Lagna Kundali, Surya Kundali and Chandra Kundali). <strong>It is wrong to view any single chart in isolation, ignoring the mutual interplay of various charts and components as parts of an integrated system : this is the gist of Systems Approach which has been briefly described above under &quot;STANDARD METHOD OF VEDIC JYOTISHA&quot; and &quot;Correct Shortcut of Vedic Jyotisha&quot;.</strong>This is the <strong>shortcut</strong> of Vedic Jyotisha. The long-cut, based on either DAC or on some special Pre-Parashari rishi based systems, are almost impractical now-a-days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;">Now some introduction must be given to finer nuances of Jyotisha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;">In Linguistics, experts recognize <span style="text-decoration: underline;">surface structures and deep structures</span> in grammar of any language. Surface structures define the rules of general grammar of a particular language based on characteristics of manifest language or Vaikhari, while deep structures give deeper and sometimes unintended meanings reflecting the deeper unconscious layers of mind of the speaker and some of the deepest structures may be related to phenomena like telepathy, clairvoyance, etc, or to Pashyanti form of language which does not use physical sounds. Another parallel can be drawn from genetics. Earlier, geneticians distinguished active genes from dormant genes, but now this static view is being discarded, because it is gradually coming to light that the so-called recessive genes do not manifest their activities directly as in the case with active genes, and these supposedly recessive genes form deeper structural relations with other, often distant, genes or static/dynamic groups of genes giving rise to those genetic functions which are inexplicable on account of mere active genes. Deep structures may have deeper hierarchies and cross-level relations. <strong>In Jyotisha, we have simpler characteristics of planets and houses which manifest directly, and we also have many combinations or yogas and esoteric entities defying logical explanation which require deeper examination to reveal their underlying relations with surface structural relations of planets and houses.</strong> For instance, Gulika is a phenomenon of deep structure which is a result of deeper relations of certain surface things and processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>In the light of this Vedic Systems Approach, we should define <em>FUNCTIONAL</em> characteristics of planets in an astrological chart, which are in contrast to <span style="color:Blue">the <em>NATURAL</em> characteristics of planets, the latter are static, fixed and always the same in all horoscopes.</span></strong> Some astrologers wrongly define functional properties of planets <em>merely</em> on the basis of lordships of houses. Functional traits of planets are dependent on structural peculiarities of the particular horoscope we have at hand, and are therefore not static or fixed traits. If a planet is lord of 11H, its function will be malefic, hence this trait is &quot;functional&quot;. Similarly, placement in a malefic house or in malefic company or aspected by some malefic planet will have some functional changes in the traits of that planet. Our conceptual framework must be systematic, uniform and organic, we cannot afford to define terms and concepts whimsically without a proper systematic approach, because <em>definitions</em> define our capability to recognize and solve problems. When we talk of functional attributes of a planet, we must define those attributes on the basis of structutal attributes (e.g., lordship of 11H is a structural attribute based on structure of a chart in the light of natural trait of ownership of signs by planets). If the structural attribute known as lordship of 11H gives rise to a certain function, ie, maleficence, then another structural attribute such as placement in 8H will give rise to a difference functional attribute which may be malefic in some context, e.g., bad for health, but good in some other context, e.g, esoteric knowledge. Out of various functional properties of a particular house in a chart, some properties manifest themselves and others may remain dormant, depending upon the influences of other charts and processes. If the dashā-kāraka planet/planets are conducive in D-24, VPC, transit, etc, then 8H in D-1 may help in gaining esoteric knowledge and at the same time health may be bad due to evil influences of various charts and processes. It means that the same house in D-1 may give positive fruit about a particular function of that house and negative fruit about a different function of same house, depending upon interplay of various charts and processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;">Now let us discuss the issue of <strong>determinism versus uncertainty in horoscopic prognostication.</strong> Is it possible to find out a foolproof method of prognostication capable of generating 100% correct predictions in all cases ? One approach to this issue is to blame the errors in predictions entirely on human fallibility of astrologers while taking the science of astrology to be potentially capable of 100% accuracy, while the other approach is to take astrology merely as a crude pointer to events. In both cases, we must find out the reasons why astrology succeeds or fails in providing predictions. Let me illustrate this problem by means of an analogy with linguistics. Researchers working in Speech Recognition conclude that &quot;the major difficulty in speech recognition is that the phonetic and linguistic properties of speech are not always reflected in the physical properties of its signal <em>in a direct way</em>. For instance, different instances of the same words by just one person can produce great variations in the speech signal. Nor is it easy to extend the information gained by analysing utterances of known words by known speakers to allow comparison against utterances of unknown words by unknown speakers.&quot; (- Richard Crouch, Univ of Cambridge). Same is the case with astrology : information gained by analysing effects of known planetary combinations of known events cannot be used to predict unknown events. Astrologers have to rely on classical rules without having any access to the methodology of deducing those rules. Besides, these classical rules do not apply invariably in all cases with foolproof accuracy, and astrologers do not know whether the classics are wrong or whether the prevalent methods of applying those rules are erroneous. As a result of myriads of planetary yogas operating in a single chart and as a result of many charts interacting with each other in a single horoscope, it is almost beyond the capability of mortals to fathom out the event for a particular point or range of time. But I view this complexity due to multiplicity of charts and combinations to be a blessing instead of a curse, because of the benefit of <em><strong>Redundancy</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Redundancy</strong> is a concept in Linguistics, Information Science, Communication Theory, Cybernetics, etc, according to which some amount of redundancy is built into the signal sent from the controller to the controlled system,entity, so that the existence of <strong>NOISE</strong> in the signal does not distort the message. In astrology, possible error in birth time is one example of <em>astrological noise</em>, other examples are mistakes in determining which chart is dominant under which conditions, or errors in recognizing the effective astrological yogas and distinguishing them from those yogas which become dormant for some specific period, etc. Owing to the possible errors in final judgment on account of such noises, there must be adequate amount of redundancy in the astrological method of chart interpretation which should help in minimizing the errors. For instance, reliance on mere LK (Lagna Kundali) will increase the errors, but if SK and CK (Surya and Chandra Kundalis) are also taken into account simultaneously (Sudarshana Chakra), then the magnitude and severity of errors in chart interpretation gets reduced. Similarly, although D-10 provides much extra information regarding career, it also contains some amount of information which may be deduced from D-1 also, and such repetitions of information about career is another example of redundancy, which should be analyzed according to classical rules of varga-vimshopaka and planetary strengths in order to minimize the possible errors. There are a large number of redundancies in almost all sub-systems and hierarchical levels of a horoscope to guide the astrologer towards better analytic results. It is a bad astrological practice to keep restricted to LK of D-1 alone as a large number of astrologers do, this is not what rishi-based classics like BPHS prescribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>BPHS is based on this ancient ORGANIC, HOLISTIC and SYSTEM approach, according to which conclusions deduced from different charts must never be taken to be final, but to be used as intermediate material in a complex network of charts and other things in any single horoscope, otherwise we will end up with elephant's leg viewed as a pillar. Herein lies the most important gist of Jyotisha :- the hallmark of a real Jyotishi lies in his/her ability to deduce the final outcome of interplay of mutual influences of many planets through conjunction, aspects, lordships, yogas, etc, and this interplay includes the interplay of many simultaneously functioning charts, such as birthtime D-1 and relevant higher divisionals, annual charts, transits, DAC charts, etc.</strong></span></p>
<p>(The so-called Systems Approach of Mr V K Choudhary is a novel invention by him in 1991 AD, having many fundamental differences with classics, and therefore his approach must not be confused with the traditional Parashari Systems Approach described by me here.)</p>

<p>Read the details of SSS on that page. That pages lacks proper definition of SSS :-</p>
<p>SSS is the traditional Indian system of astrological-astronomy used in various Puranas, eulogised as the best model by Varaha Mihira, and is the direct or indirect basis of all traditional Indian astrological almanacs even today. Among India's most prestigious universities, BHU is the only central universities which teaches Jyotisha. It publishes astrological almanac on the basis of SSS. Many provincial universities do the same. For instance, Bihar's KSD Sanskrit University publishes its astrological almanac on the basis of traditional Makaranda Table made from SSS. I updated that table according to ancient principles, and that is why JHora calls my method as &quot;generalised&quot;. I have &quot;generalised&quot; the ancient method in such a way that it automatically updates itself for4 all eras along ancient basic principles.</p>
<p>The basic tenet of ancient Siddhanta-Jyotisha is that Drik (&quot;sensorily perceived&quot;) positions of planets should not be used for astrological or religious positions, and only siddhantic longitudes of planets should be used for astrological purposes. This ancient view is in conformity with the badsic philosophy of modern science that physical (material) planets carry physical (and not astrological) properties. According to ancient classics of Vedic Jyotisha, astrological planets are Deities. And deities cannot be perceived through sense organs unless they permit it.</p>

<h1 id="toc13"><span>Rishi Parashara in Phalita Jyotisha</span></h1>
<p>Varaha Mihira named many archaic exponents of Phalita Jyotisha, among whom only the work of Rishi Parashara has survived in usable shape (Brihat, Madhya and Laghu Parashari Hora texts), besides Yavanāchārya. Western scholars give more weightage to Yavanāchārya and conclude that Indians learnt Jyotisha from Greeks. But the work of Yavanāchārya is 100% a part of Vedic-Puranic culture and religion, with no trace of Greek culture. Moreover, Mahabharata and other ancient Indian texts relate the most ancient homeland of Yavanas to Assam from where they later migrated to west. In Greek language (in koince, the lingua franca of classical period), the word &quot;euros&quot; meant &quot;easterly&quot; (according to Karl Brugmann, the greatest expert of Indo-Europeanism), hence &quot;European&quot; meant &quot;easterner&quot; or persons coming from the East. Classical Greek comedy 'The Birds' by Aristophanes at the end of 5th century BCE proves that ritualistic Yajurvedic religion was practised by the forefathers of Greeks, as per which they performed yajnas whose smoke went to the realm of gods to feed them (havi). Indo-European pantheon was also entirely Vedic. Hence, it is wrong to take a word &quot;Yavanāchārya&quot; out of proper context and conclude that Phalita Jyotisha in non-Indian in origin. Lots of Puranas and epics contain large number of verses about Phalita Jyotisha, most detailed is Narada Purana.</p>
<p>The words of Varahamihira are worth scrutiny : in the first verse of the chapter on Longevity in Bhajjātaka, he uses the word &quot;Shaktipoorvā&quot; for sage Parashara, which Bhatta Utpala correctly explained to be a synonymn for &quot;Parashara&quot;, because Rishi Shakti (son of Rishi Vasishtha) was the father of Rishi Parashara, and all these three rishis were mantra-drashtā Vedic rishis. Rishi Parashara was the last Mantra-drashtā rishi, after which no Vedic rishi came into this world. Varaha Mihira's language clearly shows that he regarded Parashara ji as the son of Vedic rishi Shakti and grandson of Rishi Vasishtha. It is nonsense to believe that Varahamihira would have regarded Parashara rishi to be a student of some yavana of 2nd century AD. Parashara Ji was the father of Veda Vyāsa Ji.</p>
<p>There is a Sanskrit adage stating 'Kalau Parāshara Smritau', which means Parāshara ji is the ultimate authority for Kaliyuga in the matters related to Vedic religion &amp;c (including Vedāngas), because he happened to be the last Vedic rishi coming at the end of Dwāpara yuga and therefore codified Dharma &amp;c for Kaliyuga.</p>
<h2 id="toc14"><span>Reliable Published Texts of BPHS (Brihat Parāshara Horā Shāstra)</span></h2>
<p>There is no single book to understand BPHS comprehensively and correctly. Here is my recommendation :</p>
<p>If you have little time to read more than one commentary of BPHS, the best version is BPHS published by Choukhamba and edited by Late Pt Devachandra Jha, because he consulted the maximum possible number of manuscripts available to him, and he never deliberately tampered with the original verses or meanings, although many of his ideas in Hindi translation are not correct, but this is the problem with all other commentaries too. As far as original Sanskrit is concerned, this is the best and most reliable version.</p>
<p>But never rely on translations, and even if the reder does not know Sanskrit, try to compare the key words in translations with the original Sanskrit, because sometimes the translators change the words with their own words and distort the meaning, either knowingly or unknowingly. This caution is for all versions.</p>
<p>Keep away from Pt Sitaram Jha's version, he tampered with the original Sanskrit verses thoroughly. English translation by R Santhanam is based on this spurious original, but Santhanam's commentary is sometimes brilliant and needs to be read.</p>
<p>Second reliable original text is by Pt Ganesha Datt Pathak, published by Thakur Prasad publishers of Varanasi, which is an unscrupulous publisher, but the original Sanskrit verses sometimes differ from other versions and are based on some genuine but unnamed manuscript.</p>
<p>No other commentary of BPHS is worth reading, because their commentators never consulted any manuscript and merely stole verses and ideas from others and created rubbish.</p>
<p>The earliest published version of BPHS is by Khemraj Press of Mumbai, but it contains nearly 1800 extra verses and it is a topic of research how many of them are genuine.</p>
<p>There were nearly 11000 verses in BPHS, in one hundred chapters, but only one third of that is now left, because the remaining dealt with higher levels of astrology, as in various Samhitā and Nadi texts, and were not preserved either due to initial Turk-Pathan invasion or lack of interest.</p>
